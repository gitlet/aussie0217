      <h3>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</h3>
      <p>Inasmuch as we breathe &amp; live in this contemporary age of <strong>Science</strong> &amp; <strong>Technology</strong>, it is quite obvious that the <strong>Computers</strong>, <strong>Information Technology</strong>, &amp; the <strong>Internet</strong> are not only ubiquitous but also these things became the integral part of our daily lives.
      <br>We tend to utilize the high-tech gadgets of our modern day era in our routine tasks, yet we never or hardly pay any attention to the underlying, powerful architecture of these magical devices &amp; the intuitive services they offer.
      <br><strong>Software</strong> is at the forefront of all the technological advancements that we see &amp; witness today.
      <br>In spite of all the intuitive nature, intelligent thinking &amp; lightening speed calculations, the Computers &amp; other electronic gadgets alike are pretty useless without our, the Human intervention..
      <br>It is us, the human beings who make these intriguing &amp; fascinating devices with the core help of <em>Software</em> by writing limitless lines of code. We do so, by making the Computer understand by letting it know through the means of passing our thoughts in the form of instructions &amp; translating it in its own binary, machine understandable language.
      </p>
      <h4>My Expertise</h4>
      <p>
        As I mentioned above, we make software by writing code in different programming languages which is not only human readable but also, after being translated i.e interpreted and &sol; or compiled, the computers can understand &amp; carry out the instructions &amp; yield the desired results.
        <br>Software developed for varied purposes has to be written in different programming languages depending on the requirements &amp; need.
        <br>Languages that I use most often for developing software are:
        <ul class="langs">
          <li>C++</li>
          <li>Java</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>C#</li>
          <li>Perl</li>
          <li>Ruby &amp; RoR</li>
          <li>Javascript</li>
          <li>PHP</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4 id="honmen">Honorable mentions</h4>
      <p>
        To the best of my knowledge &amp; in my fullest of wits,  I being a Computer Science Engineer have been consistently involved working with these technologies for local as well as international clients, fulfilling their technical &amp; digital requirements, helping them in all dimensions of technical aspects by leaps &amp; bounds.
        <br>I possess more than <strong>6 years</strong> of <em>exclusively spanned, meticulously crafted, &amp; skillfully implemented</em> experience developing Software.
        <br>Hence, I carry out any project assigned, with atmost dedication, reponsibility, passion, &amp; keen eye on detailing &amp; thus making my piece of work robust that just works in all circumstances.
